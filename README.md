### Introduction
The Deutsche Bank API provides developers with plausible costumer and bank data
to let them build great, highly connected apps.

This package is a small wrapper around the Deutsche Bank API. It aims to be
always up-to-date and cover all available http endpoints.

### Features
  - [x] Covering all endpoints
    - [x] Accounts (`/cashAccounts`)
    - [x] Addresses (`/addresses`)
    - [x] Transactions (`/transactions`)
    - [x] UserInfo (`/userInfo`)
  - [x] Selectable API version
  - [x] Easy to use
  - [x] Basic test suit

#### Todo
  - [ ] Provide authentication?

### Usage
#### Requirements
Create an account on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.db.com) and follow
the instructions there. The common workflow is to create an application and at
least one test user to get started.

#### Installation
Please use a dependency manager like [glide](http://glide.sh) to make sure you
use a tagged release.

Install using `go get`:
```bash
go get -u github.com/LukasMa/dbapi
```

#### Usage
##### Authentication
The Deutsche Bank API is secured by OAuth2 and you need an access token to
retrieve data from the endpoints. This package **does not** provide an OAuth2
client since there are many good implementations out there. To use the `dbapi`
client you need the `Access Token`.

##### Creating a new api client.
To retrieve data you need to create a new client:
```go
import github.com/LukasMa/dbapi

const AccessToken = "..."

api, err := dbapi.NewClient(
    dbapi.SetToken(AccessToken),
)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err)
}
```

Since the access token is bound to a specific user the client can only scrape
data from exactly this user.

_Please note that the user must grant the correct rights (`scopes`) during the
authentication process or you might not be allowed to access the corresponding
api endpoints._

**It is also possible to use a custom http client to make requests:**
```go
// Create your custom http client.
client := &http.Client{
    Transport: &http.Transport{
        Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
        Dial: (&net.Dialer{
            Timeout:   3 * time.Second,
            KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,
        }).Dial,
        ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
        ResponseHeaderTimeout: 3 * time.Second,
        TLSHandshakeTimeout:   3 * time.Second,
    },
}

// Use your custom http client.
api, err := dbapi.NewClient(
    dbapi.SetToken(AccessToken),
    dbapi.SetClient(client),
)
// ...
```

**Options can also be applied to a client instance if it has already been created:**
```go
api, err := dbapi.NewClient()

api.Options(
    dbapi.SetToken(AccessToken),
)
```

##### Accessing resources
Accessing the endpoints is easy. Since the API is in an early state there aren't
many enpoints, yet. A list of available endpoints can be found on the
Developer Portal > API Explorer. Or take a look at the [swagger specification](https://simulator-api.db.com/gw/dbapi/v1/swagger.json).

```go
accounts, response, err := api.Accounts.GetAll()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(response)
    log.Fatalln(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%v", accounts)
```
