### Introduction
This package is a small wrapper around the recently released Deutsche Bank API
and covers all of the available http endpoints.

The Deutsche Bank API will grow with time and so will this package.

### Features
  - [x] Cover all available endpoints
    - [x] Addresses (`/addresses`)
    - [x] Accounts (`/cashAccounts`)
    - [x] Transactions (`/transactions`)
    - [x] UserInfo (`/userInfo`)
  - [x] Basic test suit
  - [x] Easy to use package API

### Usage
#### Requirements
Create an account on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.db.com) and follow
the instructions there. The common workflow is to create an application and at
least one test user to get started.

#### Installation
Please use a dependency manager like [glide](http://glide.sh) to make sure you
use a tagged release.

Install using `go get`:
```bash
go get -u github.com/LukasMa/dbapi
```

#### Usage
##### Authentication
The Deutsche Bank API is secured by OAuth2 and you need an access token to
retrieve data from the endpoints. This package **does not** provide an OAuth2
client since there are many good implementations out there. To use the `dbapi`
client you need the `Access Token`.

##### Creating a new api client.
To retrieve data you need to create a new client:
```go
import github.com/LukasMa/dbapi

const AccessToken = "..."

api, err := dbapi.New(AccessToken)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fatalln(err)
}
```

Since the access token is bound to a specific user the client can only scrape
data from exactly this user.

_Please note that the user must grant the correct rights (`scopes`) during the
authentication process or you might not be allowed to access the corresponding
api endpoints._

**It is also possible to use a custom http client to make requests:**
```go
// Create your custom http client.
client := &http.Client{
    Transport: &http.Transport{
        Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
        Dial: (&net.Dialer{
            Timeout:   3 * time.Second,
            KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,
        }).Dial,
        ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
        ResponseHeaderTimeout: 3 * time.Second,
        TLSHandshakeTimeout:   3 * time.Second,
    },
}

// Use your custom http client.
api, err := dbapi.New(
    AccessToken,
    dbapi.SetClient(client),
)
// ...
```

##### Accessing resources
Accessing the endpoints is easy. Since the API is in an early state there aren't
many enpoints, yet. A list of available endpoints can be found on the
Developer Portal > API Explorer.

```go
accounts, response, err := api.Accounts.GetAll()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(response)
    fmt.Fatalln(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%v", accounts)
```

There are currently four endpoints with either one or two methodes to explore:
  - `api.Addresses.Get()`
  - `api.Accounts.{Get(iban string), GetAll()}`
  - `api.Transactions.{Get(iban string), GetAll()}`
  - `api.UserInfo.Get()`
